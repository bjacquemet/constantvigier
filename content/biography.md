**I was born in Quimper, France on 12th March 1991.**

**I started ballet with Liliane Kochansky-Dupont when I was 10 years old at the _Conservatoire_ in Rueil-Malmaison where I also had clarinet, music, and singing classes.**

**The following year I joined the _Conservatoire_ in Paris while taking private classes with Olivier Letu at _Atelier Choregraphique_ in Rueil-Malmaison. From 2004 to 2009 I attended the _Paris Opera Ballet School_. After graduating, I joined John Neumeier in Hamburg, Germany. I graduated from the school and joined the _Hamburg Ballet John Neumeier_ for the season 2011-2012. I danced in his "The Lady of the Camellias", "Nijinsky", "The Little Mermaid", "Liliom", "Purgatorio", "Mahler's 3rd Symphony"... This is where I discovered my passion for choreography.**

**I spent half of the following season in Copenhagen with the _Tivoli Pantomime Theatre_ before joining the _Scottish Ballet_ in 2013 in Glasgow where I have been dancing since. My repertoire includes Christopher Hampson's "Rite of Spring" and "Hansel and Gretel", Kenneth MacMillan's "Elite Syncopations", Matthew Bourne's "Highland Fling", Christopher Bruce's "Ten Poems", Hans van Manen's "5 Tangos"...**
