premiered at Dance Base Edinburgh, UK. Special Edition, Fringe Festival. 16 August 2015.

I created this piece wondering about the origin of our actions. Do we follow others and the rules of society or do we make deliberate choices? How much does a change of situation affect our behaviours?

Dancers : Ellen Elphick, Laura Joffre, Constant Vigier.

Music : Schubert's String Quintet in C major D956 : I- Allegro, ma non troppo.
