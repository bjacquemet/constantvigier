premiered at Deutschen Schauspielhaus, Hamburg, Germany. Junge Choreografen II. 27 March 2012.

This piece is a representation of my relationship with dance. There are days when everything seems possible and easy and other days when it feels much deeper and profound like a very intimate love story. However it can also be very frustrating and become a fight between the body and the mind.

Dancers : Priscilla Tselikova, Xue Lin, Yun-Su Park, Marcelino Libao, Aleix Martinez, Thomas Stuhrmann.

Music : Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto no.1 in D Minor : I- Allegro.

Mozart's Clarinet Concerto in A Major : II- Adagio.
