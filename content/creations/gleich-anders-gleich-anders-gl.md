premiered at Ernst Deutsch Theater, Hamburg, Germany. Werkstatt der Kreativit√§t II. 28 February 2011.

"Same" or "different" : such is the question of fashion. Do we follow the movement because we want to or because we want to do like everyone else and blend in?

Difference is often seen as a scary thing because it is the unknown but can't we actually take a bit of everything?

I chose not to answer this question but only to put it out there in front of the audience by working on the meeting of a group and a single "stranger".

Dancers : Aurore Lissitsky, Ornella Capece, Sofia Schabus, Christopher Evans, Takeshi Ikeda, Lizhong Wang.

Music : Beethoven's Piano Sonata no.14 in C sharp Minor Op. 27/2 : III- Presto Agitato.
