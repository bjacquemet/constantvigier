### 16-1 SERIES

“16:1” is a choreographic series and concept created by Constant Vigier.

"I saw \[a dance video\] by Constant Vigier, \[...\] A lot of little screens combined; sometimes the movements were in unison, sometimes they were slightly off. That was clever."

Alexei Ratmansky, artist in residence at American Ballet Theatre and former director of the Bolshoi Ballet, for DanceTabs.
