movie by Lewis Landini created in April 2014.

Even though this duet could be the ending of a project with a return to the roots, it is for me as a choreographer the start of a reflexion on communication.

Technology offers us incredible possibilities of communication through so many devices but however it seems harder and harder to communicate face to face.

The title for the bigger project would be "Uprooted Optimists" and that sums up very well my point of view on that matter.

Dancers : Brenda Lee Grech, Victor Zarallo.

Music : Bach's Harpsichord Concerto No.4 in A major, BWV 1055 : II- Larghetto.
