The choreography is inspired by the lyrics of Vivaldi’s score.

From the pain a mother gets as she loses her child, I tried to re-live the whole journey of one’s life. This journey brings us around the themes of motherhood, childhood, education, relationships… How much does our life depend on others’ ?... and vice versa.

Choreographer : Constant Vigier.

Dancers : Chloë Réveillon, Constant Vigier.

Music : Vivaldi's Stabat Mater.
