premiered at Dance Base Edinburgh, UK. Special Edition, Fringe Festival. 10 August 2014.

The choreography is inspired by the lyrics of Vivaldi’s score.

From the pain a mother gets as she loses her child, I tried to re-live the whole journey of one’s life. This journey brings us around the themes of motherhood, childhood, education, relationships… How much does our life depend on others’ ?... and vice versa.

Dancers : Chloë Réveillon, Constant Vigier.

Music : Vivaldi's Stabat Mater.
